# Heart-attack-detection-by-heartbeat-sensing-using-Internet-of-Things-Domain
•	In this project we are implementing a heart beat monitoring and heart attack detection using the internet of things.  
•	The sensor is interfaced to a microcontroller that allows checking heart rate readings and transmitting them over the internet.  
•	The user may set the high as well as low levels of heart beat limit. After setting these limits,the system starts monitoring and as soon as patient heart beat goes above a certain limit.  
•	The system sends an alert to the controller which then transmits this over the internet and doctor as well as concerned users.
